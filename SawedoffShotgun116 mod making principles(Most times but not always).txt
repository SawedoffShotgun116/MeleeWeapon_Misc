## Universal mod making principle of SawedoffShotgun116:

1. Make things fit the Vanilla/CE environment. Avoid Defing Overpowered or Over-weakened things.
2. Compared with Tynan, this author is a little bit more in sticking to the reallife, to the real datas, when comes to Thing stats Def(At the "1." basis).

3. Write more and detailed comments when Coding or Defing things at the Author's wish (A good habit. but not easy to insist on. \*shrug\*)

4. Technical Details
  - Match the "Combat Power" with "Combat Effectiveness" (E.g. The author would not make a pawn more powerful than Centipede Blaster(400 Combat Power) and cost only 100 Combat Power, if possible)  
  - Def a thing's marketvalue reasonably even that weapon is not unobtainable to Players (E.g. In "Empire" mod, players can arm your allies with powerful and exotic mod weapons in a very cheap price cause that weapon have no marketvalue defined.)  
  - Keep mod simple. Keep "research tab" and "build menu" clean and simple, def as less research item/building as possible.
